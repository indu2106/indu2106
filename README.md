## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for Data, Cloud, and AI. Here's a bit about my journey:

I recently worked as a **Graduate Research Assistant** at **The University of Texas at Arlington**, where I improved **data quality** and developed interactive **dashboards** to enhance decision-making processes. Prior to that, I served as a **Data Engineer** at **Concepo Engineering and Technologies Pvt Ltd** in Pune, India, where I optimized data processing and enhanced database query performance. I also have experience as an **Application Development Associate** at **Accenture** in Bangalore, India, where I streamlined data migration processes and collaborated with stakeholders in an Agile environment.

I hold a **Master of Science in Information Systems** from **The University of Texas at Arlington**, with a GPA of 3.70/4.00, and a **Bachelor of Engineering** in **Computer Engineering** from **Savitribai Phule Pune University**, with a GPA of 7.23/10.00.

My achievements include certifications in **Generative AI Fundamentals**, **Databricks Lakehouse Fundamentals**, and **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**. I also served as the **Vice-President of the Data Science Club** at **The University of Texas at Arlington**.

My technical skills span languages like **Python, R, Java, Scala, SQL, Bash, and T-SQL**, and I have expertise in **database management systems such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HBase, MS SQL Server, Cosmos DB, and Amazon DynamoDB**. I am proficient in **data warehousing technologies like AWS Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Azure Synapse Analytics**, as well as **big data technologies like Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Amazon EMR**. Additionally, I have experience with **ETL/data integration tools such as AWS Glue, Apache NiFi, Talend, Informatica, and Azure Data Factory**, along with other tools like **Linux/Unix, Docker, Kubernetes, Tableau, Power BI, Git, GitHub, Terraform, Jira, Microsoft Office Suite, and Alteryx**.

I've worked on some exciting projects that you can explore here on my GitHub. From designing data pipelines with **Azure/AWS** to developing fraud detection models for online payments, my projects showcase a range of skills in data processing, **machine learning**, and **cloud technologies**.
